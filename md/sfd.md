## Origin of Software Freedom Day

Software Freedom Day (SFD) began in 2004, with its first observance on August 28 of that year. The event was conceived by Matt Oquist, who, inspired by the idea of distributing CDs containing free software, collaborated with Henrik Omma and Phil Harper from TheOpenCD project. Their goal was to create an international day dedicated to handing out free software and educating the public about its benefits. The inaugural event saw participation from about 12 teams worldwide[^1][^6][^4].

## Evolution and Growth

- **Early Years (2004–2007):**
    - The event quickly gained traction, expanding from 12 teams in 2004 to 136 teams in 60 countries by 2005, and 286 teams in 80 countries by 2007[^1].
    - In 2006, the date was standardized to the third Saturday of September, making it easier to coordinate globally[^1].
- **Peak and Expansion (2008–2010):**
    - SFD reached its peak in 2008, with 563 registered locations in 90 countries[^1][^8].
    - By 2009, the number of participating teams rose to 700, reflecting the growing global interest in free and open-source software (FOSS)[^1].
    - During this period, the event diversified, with activities ranging from conferences and workshops to install fests and community outreach[^1].
- **Transition and Broadening Scope (2010–2016):**
    - In 2010, leadership transitioned to Frederic Muller, who broadened SFD’s focus to include hardware freedom, document freedom, and educational initiatives, reflecting the evolving landscape of digital rights and open standards[^8].
    - The organizing body, originally Software Freedom International, rebranded as the Digital Freedom Foundation (DFF) and expanded its mission to cover open hardware, open educational resources, and free culture[^5].
- **Recent Years and Challenges (2017–2025):**
    - Participation declined after 2010, stabilizing at around 400+ locations, partly due to the rise of broadband internet (reducing the need for physical media) and challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which made organizing in-person events difficult[^1][^8].
    - By 2023, the event was relaunched by a new team of volunteers, continuing its tradition of promoting software freedom and adapting to new digital challenges[^8].


## Organization and Impact

- SFD is coordinated globally by the Digital Freedom Foundation, but each event is organized locally, allowing for a wide variety of activities tailored to different communities[^1].
- The event has been supported by major organizations in the tech industry, including Canonical, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Google, Red Hat, and others[^1].
- Over time, SFD has inspired related initiatives, such as Document Freedom Day and Hardware Freedom Day, reflecting the growing movement for digital rights and open knowledge[^5].
